	<p>
		Is This Sunscreen Reef Safe? (hyperlink here) checks if that sunscreen you have your eye on is damaging our reefs. Unfortunately, most sunscreens out there are not reef-safe and most notably
		result in coral bleaching. There are many toxic ingredients (hyperlink here) mainstream sunscreen brands use that are severly damaging our reefs (check out our No-no Ingredients section!), 
		but it can be a hassle to go through every single ingredient in a sunscreen and research whether or not it is reef safe. Which is why we're here! Type in the name of the sunscreen (hyperlink)
		you are wondering about and we give you the simple answer.
